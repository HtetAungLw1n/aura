# Aura WordPress Project

This project is a demo e-commerce website built with WordPress and the WooCommerce plugin. It is designed to test WooCommerce features and serve as a presentation for the team. The site uses a WooCommerce-compatible theme and standard WordPress setup to showcase online store functionality, product management, and order processing in a local development environment.

It contains the standard WordPress core files and directories, including:

- `wp-admin/` — WordPress admin dashboard files
- `wp-content/` — User content, plugins, themes, uploads
- `wp-includes/` — WordPress core libraries and functions
- Main entry files such as `index.php`, `wp-config.php`, and others
